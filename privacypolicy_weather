Privacy Policy for Weather Action (Caribbean Princess GPT)

Effective Date: October 2025
Owner: Kelly Gareau

1. Purpose

This page explains how the Weather Action used by the Caribbean Princess GPT handles data when providing weather forecasts for cruise ports and locations.

2. What Information Is Collected

When you request weather information, the Action sends a simple API call that includes:

The geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or the name of a location you ask about.

No personal information, identifiers, or chat history are sent.

3. How the Information Is Used

The coordinates or location name are used only to retrieve current or forecasted weather data from the external weather service Open-Meteo.
The returned information may include temperature, wind, humidity, precipitation, and other weather metrics.
This data is displayed in your chat and is not stored by the GPT.

4. Data Sharing

Your query is transmitted securely over HTTPS to Open-Meteo (https://open-meteo.com).
No data is shared with any other third party.
The Action does not log, analyze, or reuse your queries for analytics or marketing.

5. Data Retention

The Weather Action does not retain or store any location data.
All data is processed in real time and discarded immediately after the response is returned.
No user profiles, cookies, or logs are kept.

6. Security

All communication between the GPT and Open-Meteo’s servers uses encrypted HTTPS requests.
No additional tracking or telemetry is implemented.

7. User Control

If you do not wish to share a location, simply avoid requesting weather information.
The GPT will not send any data until a location or port name is provided.

8. Changes to This Policy

Updates to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
Significant changes will be noted in the GPT’s description.
